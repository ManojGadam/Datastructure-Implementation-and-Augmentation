# Datastructure-Implementation-and-Augmentation
This program implements and performs comparative analysis among Hashtable,BST, R-B tree, splay tree, and skip-list.


## How to run
python -u MyMainV1.py
where MyMainV1 is the filename
This is for the inorder traversal and wallclock time 
python -u MyMainV2.py
where MyMainV2 is the filename
This is for printing the height
